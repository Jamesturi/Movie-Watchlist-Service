Now, I'll create the "Movie-Watchlist-Service" folder as requested:

To initialize a new project for your Movie Watchlist Service, here's what you need to do:

First, create the main project folder:
mkdir Movie-Watchlist-Service
Navigate into the project directory:
cd Movie-Watchlist-Service
Initialize git for version control:
git init
This command will create a new Git repository in the Movie-Watchlist-Service folder. It sets up all the necessary Git metadata in a .git directory, allowing you to track changes to your codebase from the very beginning.

Once initialized, you can verify that Git is working correctly with:

git status
This will show you the current state of your repository, which should initially indicate that there are no commits yet and no files being tracked.
